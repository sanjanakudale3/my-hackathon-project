# MediaDNA AI — SportShield 🧬
>>>>>>> c3e3017 (changes added)

MediaDNA AI is a production-ready prototype designed to solve the multi-billion dollar problem of sports media piracy. It combines **invisible steganography**, **perceptual fingerprinting**, and **Multi-Agent AI** to detect, track, and flag unauthorized content across the global internet in real-time.

## 💎 The "MediaDNA" Innovation
Unlike standard watermarking, MediaDNA implements a **Triple-Layer Defense**:

1.  **Layer 1: Invisible DNA (LSB Steganography)**  
    Embeds cryptographically secure ownership data directly into the pixel values. This data is invisible to the human eye but survives cropping, resizing, and re-compression.
2.  **Layer 2: Perceptual Fingerprinting (Average Hash)**  
    Generates a unique digital "DNA sequence" based on visual structure, allowing the system to identify the same image even if the colors are altered or filters are applied.
3.  **Layer 3: AI Threat Intelligence (Gemini + Vision)**  
    Utilizes **Google Cloud Vision** for internet-wide tracking and **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** to analyze propagation patterns, detect commercial misuse, and auto-generate legal evidence packages.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🌐 Global Internet Tracking**: Scans Twitter, Instagram, news sites, and blogs for unauthorized copies using Google's Web Detection technology.
- **🌳 Propagation Mapping**: Visualizes the spread of your content via a branching node graph, identifying "Patient Zero" for piracy leaks.
- **⚡ Anomaly Detection**: AI-driven monitoring that flags "Viral Propagation" and "Commercial Misuse" automatically.
- **⚖️ Auto-Legal Engine**: Generates pre-filled, legally sound DMCA and IT Act (India) takedown notices based on detected evidence.
- **🔒 Secure Proxy Architecture**: A full-stack Node.js backend ensures all sensitive AI and Vision API keys are hidden from the client, preventing key leakage.
- **🛠️ System Integrity Check**: Built-in diagnostic suite to validate steganography logic and API health.

## 🛠️ Deployment & Execution

### Local Development
1. `npm install`
2. Create `.env` with `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY`.
3. `npm run dev` (Starts both Vite and Express).

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Production (Cloud Run / Render)
The project is Docker-optimized and ready for one-click deployment.
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Start**: `npm start`
- **Environment**: Ensure keys are set as environment variables in your cloud provider.

2. **Set up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_cloud_vision_api_key
   ```
   *(Note: You must also configure your `window.FB_CFG` in `src/main.js` or `index.html` with your Firebase project details).*

3. **Start the Full-Stack Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will simultaneously start the secure Node.js backend (Port 3000) and the Vite frontend (Port 5173). Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## 🌐 How to Deploy (To get your Prototype Link)

Because this application utilizes a secure backend to hide API keys, it is designed to be deployed effortlessly to **Render.com** or **Railway.app** as a Full-Stack Web Service.

**Deployment Steps for Render.com:**
1. Upload this entire project to a public **GitHub** repository.
2. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) and create a free account.
3. Click **New +** and select **Web Service**.
4. Connect your GitHub account and select this repository.
5. Configure the service:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
6. Scroll down to **Environment Variables** and add:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Your Gemini Key)
   - `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY` (Your Cloud Vision Key)
7. Click **Create Web Service**. 

Render will build and deploy your app. Once finished, they will provide you with a live URL (e.g., `https://mediadna-ai.onrender.com`). This is your final **Prototype Link**!
